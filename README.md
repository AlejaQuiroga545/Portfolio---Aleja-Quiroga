# Portofolio-Aleja-Quiroga

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site was built from scratch using **HTML5** and **CSS3** to showcase my skills as a web developer and designer. It includes information about me, a collection of my projects and ways to get in touch. The site is designed with a focus on **usability, accessibility, and responsive design**.
